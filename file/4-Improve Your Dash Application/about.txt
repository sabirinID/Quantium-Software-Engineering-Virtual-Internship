# Here is the background information on your task
Unsurprisingly, any good visualiser needs a visual component. The best data visualisers aren’t just useful but aesthetically pleasing as well. If you intend to work with data, do not underestimate the power of an intuitive, visually pleasing UI. Many data analysts overlook this component of their job, but you must remember that your app will be used by humans, not machines. By spending time on the look and feel of your visualiser, you’ll ensure that human users can navigate it intuitively and enjoyably. 

Think of it as showing affection to your visualiser, dressing it up before you put it on display for the world! To illustrate, look at this example from Dash: https://dash.gallery/dash-brain-viewer/. The developers who worked on this visualisation clearly thought about how people would interact with it and considered its visual appeal. The result is a visualiser that sucks you in — their data is fun to play with!

# Here is your task
	1. Soul Foods would like a way to dig into region-specific sales data for Pink Morsels. To this end, they’d like a radio button in your visualiser which allows them to filter sales data by region. Leaning on the resources linked below, add a radio button with five options to narrow which data appear in the line chart: “north,” “east,” “south,” “west,” and “all.”
 
	2. Now it’s time to dress up your Dash app! Apply some CSS to each element to make your application more visually appealing. There are no requirements for this step other than that you put effort into making your visualiser interesting. The model answer contains an example styling, but the possibilities are infinite — make your visualiser your own!
 
	3. When you are finished, commit and push your changes, then submit a link to your repo below!
