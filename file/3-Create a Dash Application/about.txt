Task 3: Create a Dash Application

# Task Overview
What you'll learn
	How a dataset can be visualised in a variety of different ways generating a variety of narratives

What you'll do
	Meet your supervisor Blaise, a data engineer at Quantium in the retail business area
	Create a Dash app to visualise data in an informative way that answers your client’s question

# Here is the background information on your task
Data visualisation is just as much an art as a science. A particular dataset can be visualised in countless ways, many misleading, but some useful. Think of each visualisation as a different narrative governed by the same facts. By changing the narrative while leaving the facts unchanged, the facts can be made to convey an entirely different point. Here there be dragons. This is the power of data analysis — you have a dangerous amount of control over the point you convey. It’s up to you to derive that point from the data, rather than forcing the data to support a point it doesn’t actually fit.

In this case, we want to figure out what impact the price increase of Pink Morsels had on overall sales. Take a moment to think about different ways we could visualise the data to answer this question. Ideas? In the interest of creating something simple that simply works (usually a good idea, and an excellent opportunity to reinforce the KISS principle), you’ll be implementing a line chart. It may not be the most interesting visualisation in existence, but it will likely answer Soul Foods’s question with minimal embellishment to the dataset. In other words, we get a raw, unadulterated look at the data and let the data speak for itself.

# Here is your task
	1. Your task is to create a Dash app to visualise the data you generated in the last task. Lean on the resources linked below to learn more about the basics of working with Dash. Your application must incorporate the following elements:
		A header which appropriately titles the visualiser
		A line chart which visualises the sales data generated in the last task, sorted by date. Be sure to include appropriate axis labels for the chart.
 
	2. Recall the original purpose of the Dash app you are building — the goal is to answer Soul Foods’s question: “Were sales higher before or after the Pink Morsel price increase on the 15th of January, 2021?” With the visualiser complete, the answer should be obvious. Congratulations, you just answered a pertinent business question using the awesome power of quantitative data. Soul Foods will be pleased to hear all about it!
 
	3. When you are finished, commit and push your changes, then submit a link to your repo below!
